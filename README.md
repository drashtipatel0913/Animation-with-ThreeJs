# Lightning Animation With Javascript

The simulation is created using object-oriented programming principles and makes use of vectors to perform calculations. The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify for different use cases. The canvas element is used to render the simulation, and the code is optimized for performance by only updating the dots and sticks that need to be updated, reducing unnecessary computations. The rope physics simulation can be easily customized by adjusting various parameters, such as the number of segments, the gap between them, and the tension of the sticks. To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.
