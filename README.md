# Lightning Animation With Javascript

This code is a JavaScript implementation of a 2D rope physics simulation that allows users to interact with it by moving their mouse or touching the screen. The simulation is made up of individual dots that are connected by sticks, and the rope is pinned at both ends to keep it in place. The dots are affected by gravity and friction, and are attracted to the mouse or touch position, causing the rope to sway and stretch realistically. The code also includes a light image that is drawn on the last dot to give the rope a more realistic appearance.

The simulation is created using object-oriented programming principles and makes use of vectors to perform calculations. The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify for different use cases. The canvas element is used to render the simulation, and the code is optimized for performance by only updating the dots and sticks that need to be updated, reducing unnecessary computations. The rope physics simulation can be easily customized by adjusting various parameters, such as the number of segments, the gap between them, and the tension of the sticks. To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.
